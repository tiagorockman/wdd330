**Description:**  
A web app that helps students (especially international ones) filter and find universities based on important criteria: tuition cost, English/GRE/GPA requirements, programs offered, availability of CPT Day One, inclusion in the MPOWER list, dependent cost, and more.  
It will have a freemium model: free access to partial data, full access behind a login/paywall.  
Includes Google/Facebook login integration.
